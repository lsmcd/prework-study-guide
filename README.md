# prework-study-guide

## Description

This is a project for me to test the waters of web deveopment. I built this page to further my understanding and help me with future web related endeavors. I learned how website filesystems are normally structured, furthered my understanding of HTML, and learned much of the workflow most web developers use.

## Installation

Assuming you have Git installed run the command "git clone https://github.com/lsmcd/prework-study-guide" and run the "index.html" file in your web browser.

## Usage

Website I use to keep track of what I've learned:

To add more items to the list add an opening and closing list item tag under the last one in the category within the index.html file. Add your text between the first closing angle bracket and the second opening angle bracket 

```<li>(text here without parenthesis)</li>```

To add more categories the following template. 

```<section class="card" id="(Template name without parenthesis)-section">```
```    <h2>(Template name once again without parenthesis)</h2>```

```    <ul>```

```        <li>(add as many list item tag pairs as you want and put your text inside them, remove this while you're at it)</li>```

```    </ul>```

```</section>```
